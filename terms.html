<h4>Privacy Policy</h4>

<p>We are very delighted that you have chosen to use the Pianoo app (“Pianoo”, “App”). Data protection is of a particularly high priority for the operator of Pianoo, Sebastian Boldt. Pianoo is a mobile habit tracking application for iOS and macOS. This Privacy Policy explains how personal data is processed in connection with the App.</p>

<p>The use of Pianoo is generally possible without creating a user account. All habit data you enter is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to or stored on our own servers. However, certain technical data may be processed by third-party providers (such as Apple and Google Firebase) to ensure functionality and stability of the App. Where the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.</p>

<p>The processing of personal data, such as a device identifier, crash data, or other technical information relating to a data subject, shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the applicable German data protection laws. By means of this data protection declaration, we inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use, and process in connection with the Pianoo App. Furthermore, data subjects are informed of the rights to which they are entitled.</p>

<h4>1. Definitions</h4>

<p>The data protection declaration of Pianoo is based on the terms used by the European legislator for the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our data protection declaration should be legible and understandable for the general public, as well as our users. To ensure this, we would like to first explain the terminology used.</p>

<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>
    <h4>a) Personal data</h4>
    <p>Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h4>b) Data subject</h4>
    <p>Data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person, whose personal data is processed by the controller responsible for the processing.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h4>c) Processing</h4>
    <p>Processing is any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h4>d) Restriction of processing</h4>
    <p>Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h4>e) Controller</h4>
    <p>Controller is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h4>f) Processor</h4>
    <p>Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h4>g) Recipient</h4>
    <p>Recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h4>h) Third party</h4>
    <p>Third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h4>i) Consent</h4>
    <p>Consent of the data subject is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Name and address of the controller</h4>

<p>Controller for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), other data protection laws applicable in the Member States of the European Union and other provisions related to data protection is:</p>

<p>sebastian boldt</p>
<p>Gaussstrasse 196f</p>
<p>22765 Hamburg</p>
<p>Deutschland</p>
<p>Email: self.dealloc@icloud.com</p>
<p>Website: sebastianboldt.io</p>

<h4>3. Data processing in the Pianoo App</h4>

<p>Pianoo is primarily designed to operate with data stored locally on your device. We do not operate our own backend server for user data. Nevertheless, certain technical data may be processed by third-party services to ensure stability and basic functionality.</p>

<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>
    <h4>a) Local habit data</h4>
    <p>All habit entries, statistics and related content that you create in Pianoo are stored locally on your device. We, as the controller, do not have access to this data and do not transfer it to our own servers.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h4>b) iCloud backup and synchronization</h4>
    <p>If you have enabled iCloud backup or iCloud services on your Apple device, the data of the Pianoo App may be stored in your iCloud account as part of your device backup or app data synchronization. This service is provided by Apple Inc. under Apple’s own terms and privacy policy. We do not control iCloud and do not have access to your iCloud-stored Pianoo data.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h4>c) Firebase Crashlytics (crash reports)</h4>
    <p>To improve the stability and security of the App, Pianoo uses Firebase Crashlytics, a service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. Crashlytics collects technical information in the event of a crash, such as device model, operating system version, time of error, and technical details about the state of the App at the time of the crash. Crash reports may contain an IP address (typically shortened or pseudonymised) and an automatically generated identifier.</p>
    <p>This data is used solely for diagnosing and fixing technical issues and improving the reliability of Pianoo. We do not use Crashlytics data to identify you personally or to create user profiles.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>4. Legal basis for processing</h4>

<p>Art. 6(1) lit. f GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations relating to crash reporting through Firebase Crashlytics. Our legitimate interest is the improvement, stability, security and functionality of the Pianoo App.</p>

<p>Where processing is based on your consent (for example, if you explicitly enable certain optional features), Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis.</p>

<h4>5. Data transfers and recipients</h4>

<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>
    <h4>a) Apple (iCloud)</h4>
    <p>If you use iCloud backup or related Apple services, your Pianoo data may be transmitted to and stored on Apple’s servers as part of your device backup or synchronization. Apple acts as an independent controller for this processing. Please refer to Apple’s privacy policy for further details.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h4>b) Google Firebase Crashlytics</h4>
    <p>Crash data is transmitted to and processed by Google Ireland Limited and, where applicable, its affiliates. Data may be transferred to servers outside the European Union, in particular to the United States. Such transfers are based on appropriate safeguards, such as the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or equivalent instruments provided by Google.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>6. No user accounts and no marketing tracking</h4>

<p>Pianoo does not create or require user accounts. We do not use the App for personalised advertising, marketing tracking, or analytics beyond crash reporting as described above. We do not sell or rent personal data.</p>

<h4>7. Period for which personal data will be stored</h4>

<p>Local app data is stored on your device for as long as you use the App. You can delete the data at any time by removing it in the App or by uninstalling the App from your device, which will generally remove the locally stored data.</p>

<p>Crash data stored by Firebase Crashlytics is retained only for as long as necessary to analyse and resolve the underlying technical issues and in accordance with Google’s retention policies.</p>

<h4>8. Rights of the data subject</h4>

<p>Each data subject shall have the rights granted by the European legislator in the GDPR. These rights include in particular:</p>

<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>
    <h4>a) Right of access</h4>
    <p>You have the right to obtain confirmation from us as to whether or not personal data concerning you is being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data and information about the processing.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h4>b) Right to rectification</h4>
    <p>You have the right to obtain the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning you without undue delay. You also have the right to have incomplete personal data completed.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h4>c) Right to erasure</h4>
    <p>You have the right to obtain the erasure of personal data concerning you without undue delay where the conditions of Article 17 GDPR are met. This includes, for example, cases where the data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h4>d) Right to restriction of processing</h4>
    <p>You have the right to obtain restriction of processing where one of the conditions of Article 18 GDPR applies, for example if you contest the accuracy of the personal data.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h4>e) Right to data portability</h4>
    <p>You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to another controller where the conditions of Article 20 GDPR are met.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h4>f) Right to object</h4>
    <p>You have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning you which is based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. In such a case, we will no longer process the personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h4>g) Right to withdraw consent</h4>
    <p>If processing is based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h4>h) Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority</h4>
    <p>You have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>To exercise any of these rights in relation to data we control (for example, crash data), you may contact us at any time using the contact details stated above. Please note that local app data stored solely on your device can generally be managed and deleted directly by you.</p>

<h4>9. Security of processing</h4>

<p>As the controller, we implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. However, no method of transmission over mobile networks or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, absolute security cannot be guaranteed.</p>

<h4>10. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4>

<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the App, legal requirements, or processing activities. The current version is always available within the App or on our website. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly, especially after updates to the App.</p>
